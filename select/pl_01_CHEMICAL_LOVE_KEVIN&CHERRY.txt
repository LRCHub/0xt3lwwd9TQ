Gimme gimme, gimme gimme
Gimme gimme, gimme gimme
Gimme gimme chemical love,
gimme gimme
Gimme gimme chemical love,
gimme gimme
If you only knew
If only you'd see
What I've been through
Still willingful of
waiting for you
Tell me, could this be love?
How will I know
Will my heart make me
believe it so
Or do I have to trust in the way
I feel
If I could read your mind
I wanna live my life
Live in the way I feel don't
waste it
Life is a party,
let's make it hot
Don't ever stop the music
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
I feel it's true
That real love it's
longer than life
But you don't understand
I can't hide
The feeling I've inside
I'm so unsure
Is it the real love knocking at
my door
Or is it the sound of my beating
heart for you
Tell me, could this be love?
I wanna live my life
Live in the way I feel don't
waste it
Life is a party,
let's make it hot
Don't ever stop the music
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
I wanna live my life
Live in the way I feel don't
waste it
Life is a party,
let's make it hot
Don't ever stop the music
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
Gimme gimme chemical love
Gimme gimme virtual visions
Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud
